    abstract = "{We discuss the performance of the multiple-grid model parametrization in seismic tomographic inversion. Rather than mapping the velocity perturbation Δc(x) = c(x) − c0(x) on only one regular/collocated grid as many previous studies did, we obtain individual Δc(x) models on multiple grids and generate several updated velocity models during one iteration. The average of all the updated velocity models is considered to be the input model of the next iteration. Different grids should partially/fully shift from each other and/or have different grid spacings to form the multiple-grid model parametrization. The efficacy of the multiple-grid model parametrization is demonstrated through the practical example of imaging the P-wave velocity structure along the San Jacinto fault, which is one of the most seismically active faults in California. A series of synthetic recovery examples shows that the multiple-grid model parametrization generally has a better or comparable performance in capturing the heterogeneous subsurface structures than a collocated grid. The root mean square values of the traveltime residuals in the final tomographic models obtained with the multiple-grid model parametrization are smaller than those with collocated grids. Tomographic results reveal strong heterogeneities in the crust along the San Jacinto fault. Significant velocity contrasts are observable across the fault at shallow depths. A low-velocity anomaly dominates the trifurcation area of the San Jacinto fault from the middle crust to the lower crust. Relatively large earthquakes occurred at the boundaries of low-velocity structures but with high-velocity anomalies nearby. All the results suggest that the multiple-grid model parametrization can be a reliable approach in future seismic tomography studies.}",

 abstract = {Abstract Ray tracing is avoidable in seismic traveltime tomography. In this study, seismic traveltime tomography is reformulated as an eikonal equation-constrained optimization problem solved by the ray-free adjoint-state method. The resultant approach is called adjoint-state traveltime tomography. For completeness, an eikonal equation-based earthquake location method is developed to locate the hypocenters of earthquakes when necessary. The multiple-grid model parameterization is adopted to discretize the relative slowness perturbation . The step-size-controlled gradient descent method, which has an effect of damping regularization, is used to find optimal earthquake hypocenters and velocity models. The performances of the earthquake location and adjoint-state traveltime tomography methods are tested in the source area of the 2020 Mw 4.9 Anza earthquake, a seismologically active place in southern California. The obtained high-resolution P-wave velocity model demonstrates that the 2020 Mw 4.9 Anza earthquake and other historic moderate-sized Anza earthquakes occurred near or at the boundaries of low VP rocks, a typical seismogenic environment for moderate to large crustal earthquakes. Meanwhile, the source zone of the Anza earthquakes is characterized by high VP/VS, indicating the possible existence of crustal fluids as well as the critical role of fluids in the occurrence of those moderated-sized Anza earthquakes. On the whole, the well-performed eikonal equation-based earthquake location method and adjoint-state traveltime tomography method provide competent and attractive tools for hypocenter and tomographic inversions.},

 abstract = {Abstract Seismic anisotropy provides crucial information on the stress state and geodynamic processes inside the Earth. We develop a novel adjoint-state traveltime tomography method using P-wave traveltime data to simultaneously determine velocity heterogeneity and azimuthal anisotropy of the subsurface. First, an anisotropic eikonal equation is derived to model first-arrival traveltimes in azimuthally anisotropic media. Traveltime tomography is then formulated as an optimization problem constrained by the anisotropic eikonal equation, which is subsequently solved by the adjoint-state method. Ray tracing is not required. Its high accuracy is achieved by solving the anisotropic eikonal equation and the associated adjoint equation with efficient numerical solvers. In addition, an eikonal equation-based earthquake location method for azimuthally anisotropic media is developed to solve the coupled hypocenter-velocity problem. The tomography and earthquake location methods are applied to central California near Parkfield to test their performance in practice. A total of 1,068,850 first P-wave traveltimes clearly maps the velocity heterogeneity and azimuthal anisotropy in the upper and middle crust. The average P-wave velocity model shows a striking velocity contrast across the San Andreas Fault (SAF). In the upper crust, we find structural anisotropy in the SAF zone and stress-induced anisotropy off the SAF zone. In the middle crust, the fast P-wave velocity directions are generally fault-parallel due to the decreased effect of the maximum horizontal compressive stress. In all, the real-data application suggests that the new adjoint-state traveltime tomography method can be reliably used to investigate anisotropic seismic structures.},

abstract = {Abstract In this study we recast surface wave traveltime tomography as an inverse problem constrained by an eikonal equation and solve it using the efficient adjoint-state method. Specifically, recognizing that large topographic variations and high surface wave frequencies can make the topographic effect too significant to ignore, we employ an elliptically anisotropic eikonal equation to describe the traveltime fields of surface waves on undulated topography. The sensitivity kernel of the traveltime objective function with respect to shear wave velocity is derived using the adjoint-state method. As a result, the newly developed method is inherently applicable to any study regions, whether with or without significant topographic variations. Hawaii is one of the most seismically and magmatically active regions. However, its significant topographic variations have made it less accurate to investigate using conventional surface wave traveltime tomography methods. To tackle this problem, we applied our new method to invert ambient noise Rayleigh wave phase traveltimes and construct a 3D shear wave velocity model. Our results reveal features that are consistent with geological structures and previous tomography results, including high velocities below Mauna Loa Volcano and Kilauea Volcano, and low velocities beneath the Hilina Fault Zone. Additionally, our model reveals a high-velocity anomaly to the South of Hualalai's summit, which may be related to a buried rift zone. Our findings further demonstrate that including topography can lead to a correction of up to 0.8\% in the shear wave velocity model of Hawaii, an island spanning approximately 100 km with volcanoes reaching elevations exceeding 4 km.},
